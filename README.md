I wanted to create a scrpt that did not rely on Python c+ and used common Linux commands.

Tested configs
I canâ€™t test every single version of Linux, but I have written some legacy scripts for Red Hat Enterprise 4,5, and 6. These should work on all versions of Red Hat and possibly a few others that are basic.

Note that Netstat is not installed by default on most Ubuntu systems. The command will fail but it's a soft fail.
There is a slight fork for Centos 7 this file will disappear over time and will be incorporated into the main project.
Please see the data matrix.pdf for more info.

Over the next weeks and months, I will start to add error checking just to tidy things up.
